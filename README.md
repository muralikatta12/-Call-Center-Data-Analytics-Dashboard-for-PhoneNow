### Data Sources :
- Call Center Data: The primary dataset for this analysis is the "call_center.csv" file, which contains comprehensive details on each call handled by the company. This 
  dataset will be used to generate key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide insights into overall call center performance, customer satisfaction, call handling 
  efficiency, and agent productivity. The resulting Power BI dashboard will enable PhoneNow’s Call Center Manager, Claire, to make informed decisions and drive improvements in 
  call center operations.
